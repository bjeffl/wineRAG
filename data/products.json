We no longer plow this vineyard. The life in soil is more full of life/microbes and with cover crops that retain moisture better. The walk behind two-wheel tractor is the only way to get between the old narrow rows to trim cover crops. Just part of our ongoing work to redefine what 'cultivate' means and with balance on the farm grow tastier fruit...' The 2019 seems to reflect a warmer and drier year, possibly with a shorter cycle. Initially, the wine doesn't seem as balanced and refined as the 2018, especially in the texture of the tannins, but with time it blossomed and didn't stop changing in the glass; after a couple of hours, it was simply spectacular.

It's marked as lot #106, as it's the 106th wine they have bottled since 2001. I left this wine in the glass for a long time, and it didn't stop changing and improving. At first, it felt a little rougher than the 2018, but it opened up and cleaned in the glass, and in the end it was as good (and perhaps better!). It reveals the more floral side of Cari\u00f1ena, with low alcohol (13.5%) and notable acidity (6.33 in tartaric) and freshness (pH 3.25!), vibrant and long. These are intellectual wines that require time but are deeply satisfying. I have to say that I kept changing my mind (and my scores!) as the wines developed in the glass; they are not to be assessed quickly. They are a moving target!

    "description": "This is a wine that was envisioned by Stoyka after a trip with other winemakers to Italy, where field blends are part of the winemaking tradition. Stoyka wanted to gather up a variety of grapes from the estate, pick them all at once, press them and vinify using the oldest sparkling method in the world, predating the methode traditionelle, a naturally paused fermentation that restarts in spring to complete the 'bubbly' effect in the bottle. This is finished in a crown cap and left undisgorged while the lees remain in bottle and contribute texture and an intriguing hazy hue. The three grapes - Riesling, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc - need to be separated before joining together because VQA does not allow unidentified 'field blends,' and therefore each variety needs to be weighed and the information sent to the authority for approval. So, a lot of work for such a fun and simple, lightly effervescent bubbly wine. There is nothing funky about this, it's fresh, bright, enticing and intriguing with a lovely nose of bright lemon, white peach, nectarine, kiwi, and passionfruit. It's absolutely delicious on the palate, so bright and cheery with a soft, tickling bubble and firm vein of acidity on the finessed finish tying all those flavours above into a neat little bow. At 11% abv, flip the cap and pour in whatever glass you have handy and enjoy! Score - 92. (Rick VanSickle, winesinniagara.com, May 16, 2023)",
